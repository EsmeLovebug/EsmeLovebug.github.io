            <b>
                Crown Shyness
                </b>(also <i>canopy disengagement</i>,<sup>[1]</sup>
                <i>canopy shyness</i>,<sup>[2]</sup> or <i> inter-crown 
                spacing</i>) is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, 
                in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each 
                other, forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup>
                The phenonmenon is most prevalent among trees of the same 
                species, but also occurs between trees of different 
                species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as to
                why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior and research suggests 
                that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.
