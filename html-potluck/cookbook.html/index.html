            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>3 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
                <li>5 tablespoons salted butter, at room temperature</li>
                <li>1 cup hot water</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. 
                    Add the butter, then pour over the hot water. Stir until a 
                    shaggy dough begins to form.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn the dough out onto a floured counter. Use your hands to
                    knead the dough for 1-2 minutes until it forms a smooth ball
                    . 
                    Cover the bowl with a damp towel and let rest 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cut the dough into 12-14 equal wedges, then roll each wedge 
                    into a ball (they don't need to be perfect). Use a rolling 
                    pin 
                    or a tortilla press to roll the dough out into an 8 – inch 
                    circle.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a small drizzle of 
                    olive oil, then a tortilla. Cook 30-60 seconds, until little 
                    bubbles appear on the surface. Flip and cook another 
                    30 seconds, 
                    or until the bottom is slightly golden. Set on a plate and 
                    cover 
                    with a towel. Repeat with the remaining dough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Serve warm or save for later. Keep the tortillas stored 
                    in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
                </li>

                <li>2 cloves garlic minced</li>
                <li>6 cups chicken broth</li>
                <li>1 (14-ounce) can crushed tomatoes undrained</li>
                <li>1 jalapeño pepper stemmed, seeded, and minced</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
                <li>3 cups cooked chicken diced or shredded</li>

                <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>

            <h3>Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large saucepan, heat olive oil over medium-high heat 
                    until 
                    shimmering. Add onion, carrots, and celery. Cook, stirring 
                    occasionally, until the vegetables have softened, about 5 
                    minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir in the garlic until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in 
                    the broth, tomatoes, jalapeño, cumin, and coriander.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring to a boil; reduce heat and simmer, uncovered, for 20 
                    minutes. Stir in chicken and cilantro (if using). Season to 
                    taste (I like 1 teaspoon salt and ½ teaspoon pepper). Serve, 
                    offering, cheese, sour cream, avocado, and tortillas or 
                    your favorite toppings.

            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        At least 2 hours ahead, make the pie dough: 
                    </b>
                    Make the pie crust 
                    through step 5 according to my directions and video tutorial 
                    in 
                    my pie crust recipe. Make pie dough in advance because it 
                    needs 
                    to chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours before 
                    rolling 
                    out (step 2). The recipe makes 2 crusts, and you only need 
                    1 for 
                    this pie, so save the other for another pie.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Roll out the chilled pie dough:
                    </b>
                    On a floured work surface, roll 
                    out one of the discs of chilled dough. Turn the dough about 
                    a 
                    quarter turn after every few rolls until you have a circle 
                    12 
                    inches in diameter. Carefully place the dough into a 9-inch 
                    pie 
                    dish. Tuck it in with your fingers, making sure it is 
                    completely smooth. To make a lovely thick edge, I do not 
                    trim 
                    excess dough around the edges. Instead, fold the excess 
                    dough 
                    back over the edge and use your hands to mold the edge into 
                    a 
                    rim around the pie. Crimp the edges with a fork or use your 
                    fingers to flute the edges. (Review this how to crimp and 
                    flute 
                    pie crust page if you need extra help with this step.) If 
                    dough 
                    is too warm, fluting/crimping will be difficult, so you can 
                    always chill it in the refrigerator for 5–10 minutes first. 
                    After fluting/crimping the edges, chill the pie dough in the 
                    refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to 5 days. Cover
                    the pie crust with plastic wrap if chilling for longer than
                    30 minutes. Chilling the shaped dough helps prevent the 
                    crust 
                    from shrinking.
                </li>
                <li>
                    While the crust is chilling, preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Blind bake the crust:
                    </b>
                    Line the chilled pie crust with parchment 
                    paper. (Crunch up the parchment paper first so that you can 
                    easily shape it into the crust.) Fill with pie weights or 
                    dried 
                    beans. (Note that you will need at least 2 standard sets of 
                    pie 
                    weights to fit.) I like to push the weights up against the 
                    sides of the pie crust to help ensure the sides don’t 
                    shrink 
                    down. Bake until the edges of the crust are starting to 
                    brown, 
                    about 15–16 minutes. Remove pie from the oven and carefully 
                    lift 
                    the parchment paper (with the weights) out of the pie. Prick 
                    holes all over the bottom crust with a fork. If desired for 
                    a 
                    shiny golden crust, brush egg wash on edges. Return pie 
                    crust 
                    to the oven and bake for 14–15 minutes, or until bottom has 
                    browned. Remove from the oven, and cool on a wire rack 
                    completely before filling. You can blind bake the crust up 
                    to 
                    3 days ahead of time. Cover cooled crust tightly and 
                    refrigerate 
                    until ready to fill
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>
                        Make the custard filling:
                    </b>
                    Whisk the egg yolks and cornstarch 
                    together. (A fork works nicely for this, or a small whisk.) 
                    Set aside. Combine the milk, heavy cream, sugar, and salt in 
                    a 
                    medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk until all the sugar 
                    has 
                    dissolved, then bring to a gentle simmer, whisking 
                    occasionally. 
                    Once simmering, remove about 1/2 cup (120ml) of the milk 
                    mixture 
                    and, in a slow and steady stream, whisk into the egg yolk 
                    and 
                    cornstarch mixture. Keep those egg yolks moving so they 
                    don’t 
                    scramble. In a slow and steady stream, pour and whisk the 
                    egg 
                    yolk mixture into the pot. The pudding will immediately 
                    begin 
                    to bubble and thicken. Stand back and use caution as the 
                    bubbles 
                    may burst. Cook for 1 full minute, whisking constantly.

                <li>
                    Remove the pan from heat and whisk in the vanilla and 
                    butter. 
                    You will have about 3 cups of filling. If you notice a lot 
                    of 
                    little chunks of egg yolk, they may not have been tempered 
                    properly. To fix, you can run the warm custard through a 
                    fine 
                    mesh sieve.

                    Place a piece of plastic wrap directly on top of the warm 
                    pudding to prevent a skin from forming on top. Allow to cool 
                    for 15 minutes. I do not recommend any longer than this, 
                    as it will be too thick to spread neatly into the crust.

                    Slice 2–3 bananas and arrange slices into the cooled pie 
                    shell. 
                    Sprinkle with cinnamon, if desired. Spread custard on top 
                    (it’s ok if it is still slightly warm). An offset spatula is 
                    helpful for spreading. Place a piece of plastic wrap 
                    directly on top of the custard; again, to prevent a skin 
                    from forming. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours and up to 1 
                    day.

                        When ready to serve, or up to 1 hour before serving, 
                        make the 
                        whipped cream: 
                    </b>
                    Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a 
                    whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, and vanilla 
                    extract on medium-high speed until medium peaks form, about 
                    3–4 minutes. Medium peaks are between soft/loose peaks and 
                    stiff peaks and are the perfect consistency for topping and 
                    piping on desserts.

                    Pipe or spread the whipped cream on top. Slice remaining 
                    banana 
                    and garnish with banana slices and serve pie immediately, or 
                    refrigerate for up to 1 hour and then garnish with banana 
                    slices 
                    and serve. (Best to garnish with banana slices immediately 
                    before serving, but whipped cream can go on the pie up to 1 
                    hour 
                    in advance.)

                    Slice and serve. Cover leftovers and store in the 
                    refrigerator 
                    for up to 5 days.
