                <p>
                    I am Mettaton, the one and only glamorous, gorgeous, and 
                    absolutely fabulous robot star of the Underground! I was 
                    created by the brilliant Dr. Alphys, originally as a humble 
                    human–eradication robot 
                    <i>
                        (yes, yes, very dramatic)
                    </i>
                    but I quickly discovered my true calling: SHOWBIZ. I host 
                    game shows, cooking shows, news broadcasts, really anything 
                    that lets me shine under the spotlight. My charm? Impeccable. 
                    My fashion sense? Unmatched. My ratings? Through the roof, 
                    naturally. And if you’ve heard whispers about me having a 
                    more… “soulful” form beneath all this metal. Well, darling, 
                    every star has a few secrets behind the curtain. But above 
                    all, remember this: I was built to entertain, inspire, and 
                    dazzle! Aaand 
                    <b>
                        NOBODY
                    </b>
                    does it better than me.
                </p>
                <h3 class="true-gossip">Let's get into it!</h3>
                <p>
                    Oh 
                    <b>
                        honey
                    </b>, pull up a chair because I have tea about Asgore. 
                    So you know Asgore—King Fluffybuns himself? The big, soft, 
                    dad-energy monarch of the Underground? Well, let me tell 
                    you, his whole “fearsome king” vibe is… let’s just say not 
                    the full story. First of all, everyone acts like he’s this 
                    terrifying ruler, but please—this man gardens. He tends to 
                    little golden flowers like they’re his emotional support 
                    children. And the way he makes tea? Sweetheart, the drama 
                    people whisper about is not political turmoil—it's about 
                    how he brews a cup so perfect it could make a grown monster 
                    cry. And don’t even get me started on his breakup with 
                    Toriel. Oh my goodness. You’d think the king of monsters 
                    would handle heartbreak with some dignity, but no—he’s 
                    basically been moping around his castle, trying to look 
                    regal while clearly dying inside every time someone 
                    mentions her. The man is still holding onto her chair at 
                    the dinner table. Tragic. Adorable. A mess. And between 
                    you and me? Everyone pretends not to notice, but he’s 
                    absolutely the type to rehearse Big Powerful Speeches™ in 
                    the mirror before greeting a human. Big cape, big beard, 
                    big softie. 
                    <br><br>
                    <b>
                        Anyway, 
                    </b>
                    that’s the scoop. Asgore: 50% king, 
                    50% teddy bear, 100% trying his best.
