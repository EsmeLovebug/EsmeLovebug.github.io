        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <h3>Make The Date Cake</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and line an 8-inch square 
                pan or similar baking dish with parchment paper.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place chopped dates in a medium heatproof bowl. Bring the milk 
                to a boil, then immediately pour it over the dates. Stir in the 
                baking soda (the mixture will bubble up) and let it sit to 
                soften while you prepare the rest.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and 
                light brown sugar until light and fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla 
                extract.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add the pumpkin purée and the date mixture to the bowl and mix 
                until fully combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, 
                salt, and pumpkin pie spice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet mixture until just 
                combined — do not overmix.
            </li>
            <li>
                Spread batter evenly into the prepared pan and bake for <b>30 to 
                 35 minutes</b>, or until a toothpick inserted in the 
                 center comes out clean.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make the Toffee Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                While the pudding bakes, melt the butter in a medium
                saucepan over medium heat.
            </li>
            <li>
                Stir in the dark brown sugar, heavy cream, cinnamon, salt, and 
                vanilla.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bring to a gentle simmer, whisking constantly, until smooth and 
                slightly thickened, about 5–7 minutes. Remove from heat.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Let the pudding cool for about 10 minutes. Optional: poke holes 
                across the top with a skewer or fork. Pour some of the warm 
                toffee sauce over the pudding to soak in.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slice into squares or spoon into bowls, topping each portion 
                with extra toffee sauce.
            </li>
            <li>
                Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of 
                whipped cream for the full experience.
            </li>
        </ol>
